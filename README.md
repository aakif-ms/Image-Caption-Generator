# Image Caption Generator 🖼️➡️📝

An end-to-end deep learning project that generates captions for images using a CNN-RNN architecture.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an image captioning system that combines:
- **CNN Encoder**: ResNet50 (pretrained) for feature extraction
- **RNN Decoder**: LSTM for caption generation
- **Dataset**: Flickr8k for training and evaluation
- **Demo**: Streamlit web application
